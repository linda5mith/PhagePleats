# PhagePleats ğŸ§µğŸ¦ 

**PhagePleats** is a toolkit for analyzing, clustering, and classifying phage genomes based on structural protein content. It provides a streamlined pipeline for computing protein similarity, defining novel clades, and predicting taxonomy based on shared protein profiles.

## ğŸš€ Features

- ğŸ§¬ Compute % shared proteins between phage genomes
- ğŸ“Š Cluster genomes into clades using UMAP + Leiden/Louvain
- ğŸ”¬ Predict taxonomic ranks (Order, Family, Subfamily, Genus)
- ğŸ§  Trainable model based on structural protein presence/absence
- ğŸ§ª Benchmarking and quality control tools for model predictions

## ğŸ“¦ Installation

Clone the repository and set up the environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linda5mith/PhagePleats.git
cd PhagePleats
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate phagepleats
