MissingOutputException in rule foldseek_search in file /home/administrator/phd/PhagePleats/Snakefile, line 64:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
alignments/aln
Removing output files of failed job foldseek_search since they might be corrupted:
/home/administrator/phd/PhagePleats_out_08:04:25/log/foldseek_log.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
