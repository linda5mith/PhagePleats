MissingOutputException in rule foldseek_search in file /home/administrator/phd/PhagePleats/Snakefile, line 47:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/home/administrator/phd/PhagePleats_out/foldseek_out/aln
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
